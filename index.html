        <h1>The Hope Center Journey</h1> 
        <p>By way of history, the Hope Center was New Castle County’s response to the pandemic and provided
           much needed additional safe, secure, non-congregate emergency shelter for Delaware’s most vulnerable.
          Purchase of the prior Sheraton Hotel occurred December 1, 2020, with the doors opening December 15,
          2020, the day before the first nor’easter. We initially housed 73 street level homeless under 
          Delaware’s Code Purple Program operated by Friendship House who transitioned as the Hope Center 
          social services anchor. On December 29, 2020, we began referrals from the Delaware Division of 
          State Service Centers’ Emergency Hotel Voucher Program. The goal was to keep vulnerable populations 
          safe from COVID-19 by providing shelter, however, the idea to provide onsite comprehensive services 
          began to take root. We did not want to provide shelter, we wanted to offer a safe and stable 
          environment coupled with resources and support to combat social constructs that bar many from getting
          back on their feet. This was the life blood that pumped through those involved with this project.
          Much like building an airplane while flying, many thought it radical thinking, we saw it as necessity.
          Homelessness is a barometer of social justice that reflects a serious problem in our society, and 
          that the solution IS within our grasp.<br><br> The metamorphosis from shelter to life-changing hub of vital
          resources and social support for those experiencing homelessness is blossoming at the Hope Center. 
          Working with community organizations, we offer onsite services and resources to those we serve in 
          areas that are contributing factors to homelessness but on their own the assistance may be lacking,
          unavailable, or daunting. Services include comprehensive and holistic behavioral health services 
          through the Delaware Division of Substance Abuse and Mental Health’s Bridge Clinic, primary
          care through Christiana Care’s Center for Hope and Healing, and case management through Delaware 
          Center for Homeless Veterans. In addition, our partnerships allow guests access to Grab & Go meals, 
          provided by Kings Table (if not connected to SNAP benefits), onsite assistance with emergency 
          housing voucher renewals through Delaware Division of State Service Centers, assistance with benefits
          i.e., SNAP (food), purchase of care (childcare), etc. through Delaware State and Social Services 
          (DSS), shuttle service 7 days a week to and from a major bus hub, provided by Grace Transportation,
          after-school programming for children provided by Let’s Grow, Act, Win and United Way, workforce 
          development through Fair Chance, pet care through Faithful Friends, rental and utility assistance 
          through Family Promise and our onsite Community Navigators (Delaware Housing Authority Grant) 
          completing Delaware Housing Assistance Program applications.<br><br> The Hope Center operates by referral only.
          Most Hope Center referrals are through the Delaware Division of State Service Centers. We are excited
          to have expanded our referral network and currently receive referrals from the Delaware Center for 
          Homeless Veterans (as well as our social services anchor, they run a program for veterans and pay 
          for 15 rooms), Christiana Care (with 5 rooms for those experiencing homelessness to achieve medical
          stability following care), Delaware Center for Justice (Reentry), Project New Start (Reentry), the 
          Community Education Building Family Resource Center (houses charter schools), United Way, and 
          Salvation Army (trafficking victims). <br><br>The Hope Center works with Jewish Family Services to provide
          short-term housing to refugees, the most recent from the Ukraine. We have housed flood victims from
          Hurricane Ida and households displaced from an emergency building condemnation. We have 168 rooms
          that can be occupied and for most of 2021 and 2022 our occupancy hovered over 80 percent. This 
          equates to a daily occupancy of 400 people, half of which were children under the age of 18. 
          Having a hotel allows us to help when it is needed. We are starting an Academic Enrichment 
          Program in the beginning of 2023 as well as bringing a consultant to assist with growth and 
          funding and performance metrics. As we build the Hope Center model from the ground up, it requires 
          flexibility, versatility, and patience. We cannot allow “perfection to be the enemy of progress” 
          Winston Churchill. For most of 2020/2021, our goal was keeping unhoused people safe from COVID-19, 
          as we move away from that goal, people who enter the Hope Center are entering a program and are called
          “Participants”. Case managers engage at intake and provide support. Within 24 hours, Participants complete
          a housing assessment and exit strategy.<br><br> We have learned through the Hope Center journey that households 
          need at least 90 days to stabilize and secure housing. We are grateful to the Delaware Division of State
          Service Centers for their partnership through COVID-19 and commitment to the most vulnerable. As the 
          Delaware Division of State Service Centers move back to pre-pandemic support of $1200 per household or 
          up to 24 days (based on a $50 per night rate at the Hope Center), our goal is to provide households a 
          66-day extension to have time and opportunity to utilize the onsite services, identify and address 
          barriers, and carve their pathway to permanent housing. We are doing this through our “Extend a Stay” 
          campaign. Please consider supporting this important campaign. Information can be found at Extend a Stay
          We believe removing the barrier of living in the “fight or flight” response and remove anxiety related 
          to getting your basic needs met exponentially improves a household’s chances of achieving long term housing
          stability. Everyone deserves to know they have a place to lay their head, be safe, and have a meal. Each 
          household is unique in this journey; however, once this belief of breaking the cycle manifests, it is the 
          greatest feeling to believe a change in within their grasp. We had no model to follow. We are onto something
          that has the potential to change the way services to those experiencing homelessness is delivered.<br><br> 90 days is 
          crazy people say, but so is building an airplane while flying! We believe it can be achieved and that our community,
          working together, can do it! Housing Bootcamp, we call it! Everyone has a journey not to be replicated.<br><br> To see how it
          all came together, please check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHot4QDi7NY">The Pathway Home</a> an Emmy Award winning documentary about the Hope Center.<br>
