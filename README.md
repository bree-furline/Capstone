Capstone Project
Introduction:

The objective of this project is to apply the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the course to build a multi-page website clone. The website will be picked from a list that we will provide. This project aims to showcase proficiency in web development, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while replicating the design, functionality, and user experience of the chosen website.

Project Scope:

The scope of this project encompasses the development of a multi-page website that closely resembles the chosen website. The clone will include various pages, such as a homepage, product/service listings, about us, contact, and any other relevant pages present in the original website. The focus will be on replicating the overall visual appearance, layout, navigation, and functionality of the original website.

Objectives:

Select a website for cloning: Identify a suitable website for replication based on the list provided

Replicate visual design: Analyze the visual elements of the selected website, including typography, color schemes, layouts, and images, and recreate them using HTML and CSS.

Implement responsive design: Ensure that the cloned website is responsive and adapts well to different screen sizes and devices.

Replicate functionality: Study and reproduce the key functionalities of the original website using JavaScript or relevant frameworks/libraries if necessary.

Create multiple pages: Develop multiple interconnected pages that mimic the structure and content of the original website.

Enhance user experience: Implement intuitive navigation, interactive elements, and any additional features that enhance the user experience of the cloned website.

Optimize performance: Optimize the website’s loading speed, file sizes, and code structure to ensure efficient performance.

Deploy the website: Host the cloned website on a server or deploy it on a suitable web hosting platform to make it publicly accessible.

Methodology:

The project will be divided into the following phases:

Planning and Research:

Select a suitable website for cloning, considering personal interest and complexity.

Conduct a thorough analysis of the chosen website’s structure, design elements, and functionality.

Document the key features, layout, color schemes, typography, and any other relevant details of the original website.

Design and Development:

Create a wireframe or mockup of the cloned website, ensuring it closely resembles the original website’s layout and design.

Use HTML and CSS to replicate the visual design, incorporating the identified color schemes, typography, and layout elements.

Develop responsive design using media queries and other techniques to ensure the website is optimized for different devices.

Implement JavaScript or relevant frameworks/libraries to recreate the interactive features and functionalities of the original website.

Create multiple pages and interlink them to replicate the original website’s structure and navigation.

Testing and Refinement:

Perform rigorous testing to identify and fix any bugs or issues in the cloned website.

Ensure the website is compatible across multiple browsers and devices.

Optimize the performance by reducing file sizes, compressing images, and improving code efficiency.

Seek feedback from users or peers to identify areas of improvement and make necessary refinements.

Deployment:

Configure domain settings and deploy the website to make it publicly accessible.

Conduct final checks to ensure the website is working correctly and resolves any last-minute issues.

Deliverables:

Cloned multi-page website with a design closely resembling the chosen website.

Source code repository containing all the project files and assets.

Documentation detailing the process, challenges faced, and solutions implemented.

Deployment instructions, if applicable.
